# scripts/lib/runfiles.sh — where the deploy/seed scripts put scratch files.
#
# SOURCE THIS, never execute it.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# Every one of these paths used to be a FIXED NAME directly under /tmp:
# /tmp/uplands-oracle-prices.txt, /tmp/uplands-sim.log, and friends. Two
# properties of /tmp make that dangerous rather than merely untidy:
#
#   · it is world-writable, so any local user can create the name first, and
#   · it is STICKY (mode 1777), so a file another user owns CANNOT be removed
#     or replaced by us — our own `rm -f` fails silently. A plant is therefore
#     PERSISTENT, not a race we might win by running first.
#
# That mattered because deploy.sh read field 2 of the price snapshot straight
# into an awk PROGRAM TEXT, and awk has system(): arbitrary code execution as
# the operator, on the mainnet deploy path. The awk call sites are fixed
# separately (bind with -v, validate the value); this file removes the plant.
#
# .run/ lives inside the checkout (gitignored, see .gitignore), is owned by
# the operator and is not world-writable — so nobody else can pre-create these
# names and `rm -f` means what it says.
#
# WHY NOT `mktemp -d` PER RUN. Some of these files are the interface BETWEEN
# processes: inject_history.sh (a child process) writes the price snapshot,
# and deploy.sh / seed.sh / play_start.sh / simulate_trading.sh read it back.
# A per-run directory that only the parent knows about would silently break
# that hand-off — the readers would find nothing and fall back to stale
# hardcoded prices, which is exactly the failure play_start.sh's own comment
# describes (the sim walking a fresh AMM off its real price). One stable,
# operator-owned directory is the correct shape here; MDX_RUN_DIR is honoured
# from the environment and exported so a parent and its children always agree.
