#
# SOURCE THIS, never execute it.
#
# There were two mechanisms doing the same job and they could disagree:
# gen-did.sh WROTE the published contract with `mops generate candid`, while
# lint-ratchet.sh VERIFIED it with `moc --idl`. Two tools that merely ought to
# produce identical bytes is a bad shape for a check whose entire purpose is
# byte-equality — and `mops generate candid` additionally needs ic-mops >= 2.19,
# which is why gen-did.sh could not run on a machine whose CLI was 2.13.2 while
# the ratchet verifying its output ran fine.
#
# Now generator and verifier both call mdx_emit_candid, so "fresh" means
# "identical to what the pinned moc emits", by construction rather than by
# coincidence.

# mdx_emit_candid <output.did>
#   Extracts the backend interface to <output.did>. Needs only the pinned moc
#   (mops.toml [toolchain]) — no ic-mops version floor.
#
#   --idl makes moc emit the interface as a side effect of codegen; the wasm is
#   a throwaway. This is the same invocation lint-ratchet.sh has always used.
#   The moc flags repeat lint-ratchet.sh's MOC_FLAGS on purpose — that copy is
#   pinned by tests/test_deploy_hygiene.sh §5 and must not be "simplified" away.
