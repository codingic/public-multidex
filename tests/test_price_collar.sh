# Price collar: tight on MARKETABLE orders, loose on RESTING ones.
#
# The 100x band (PRICE_BAND_FACTOR) is a fat-finger guard — its own error text
# says "likely an input error" — and it permits a print anywhere from mark/100
# to mark*100. Two colluding accounts could therefore move value at will: one
# rests far off the mark, the other takes it, and thousands of dollars cross on
# a trade that is not a trade. The board ranks on profit, so a bought print is
# a bought rank. Self-trade prevention does not see this: the two sides are
# genuinely different beneficiaries.
#
# The collar binds only orders that would EXECUTE NOW, and stays wide for
# orders that merely rest. The asymmetry is the point:
#
#   * A RESTING order priced absurdly is an OFFER to the whole venue, not a
#     transfer. Anyone can take it — including the protocol arbitrageur, which
#     exists to take exactly this — so the attacker cannot choose who fills it.
#     Far-from-market resting orders are also a legitimate strategy (a bid far
#     below, waiting for a crash), so banning them would cost real function to
#     prevent nothing.
#   * A MARKETABLE order names the price AND the counterparty, because it
#     executes against a specific resting order in the same instant. That is
#     where the transfer actually happens, so that is what the collar binds.
#
# What this pins:
#   §1 a marketable buy far ABOVE the mark is REFUSED (the wash take)
#   §2 a marketable sell far BELOW the mark is REFUSED (the other direction)
#   §3 a RESTING sell far above the mark is ALLOWED (waiting for a rally)
#   §4 a RESTING buy far below the mark is ALLOWED (waiting for a crash)
#   §5 ordinary trading at the mark is untouched
#   §6 the loose fat-finger band still catches genuinely absurd input
#
# NOTE on direction, which is easy to get backwards: a SELL far BELOW the mark
# is marketable (it crosses the bid and executes at once), and a SELL far ABOVE
# it rests. Buys are the mirror. "Far from the mark" alone does not say which.
#
# ⚠️ Places real orders on the configured venue; cancels what it places.

# PRECONDITION: the book's touch must lie INSIDE the collar band.
#
# Two different reference points are in play, and the test is only meaningful
# when they agree. The collar is measured from the AMM pool's refPrice
# (priceBandCheck, main.mo), but MARKETABILITY is measured against the BOOK
# (isMarketable → findBestMatch). If the touch sits outside refPrice ± the
# band, then a probe at ±6% cannot cross anything, is therefore not
# marketable, and the collar is never consulted — the assertion then fails
# saying "not refused" when the collar was simply never reached.
#
# This is not hypothetical: on a #dev venue seeded by cold_start the BTC book
# has been observed resting near $75,000 against a pool refPrice of $64,179
# (17% apart). Nor can the test paper over it by quoting its own maker inside
# the band — a post-only order there crosses the far-side book and is killed
# at release, which is exactly what happens. So detect it and say so.

# print: candid pretty-prints the depth record across lines, and a parse that

# response — which made this precondition exit "no two-sided book" as a
# SILENT pass on venues that had a perfectly good book.
