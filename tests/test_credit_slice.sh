#
# Regression for the deposit-credit SLICE invariant (backend creditAndRegister).
#
# creditAndRegister(user, token, amount, seq) must credit the NEWLY-confirmed
# slice `seq − creditedSeq`, NOT the caller's `amount`. The Bridge derives
# `amount = confirmed − claimed` and `seq = confirmed`, advancing its `claimed`
# high-water only on a received #ok. On the IC a reply can be lost after the DEX
# already committed: the Bridge's `claimed` then lags, and a later retry (after
# MORE deposits confirmed) sends an `amount` that OVERLAPS the already-credited
# prefix. Crediting the raw `amount` there double-mints. The fix credits the
# seq-delta, so the overlap is de-duplicated.
#
# This drives creditAndRegister directly as controller (the Bridge's role),
# reproducing the lost-reply-then-confirm sequence without Bridge orchestration.
# On #dev the play allowance cap is null, so credits are pure (no reservation
# math in the way) — exactly the path a custody #production bridge would hit.
#
# NON-DESTRUCTIVE: a throwaway identity, no resetExchange.
