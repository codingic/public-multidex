# Property-based fuzz test. Runs N rounds of randomized order
# placement against a fresh canister, then asserts global invariants.
#
# Goal: catch the kind of accounting drift that example-based tests
# miss because they exercise only specific code paths. Random orders
# of mixed sides + qty + price across all four markets exercise many
# combinations that we'd never enumerate by hand.
#
# What's a property here?
#   1. Total token supply per token is conserved
#      (no money created/destroyed across all the random trades).
#   2. No 0-qty zombie orders left on any book at the end.
#   3. Every "ok" placeLimitOrder either rests as a real order
#      (>0 qty) or settles into trades or pending matches — no
#      ghost state.
#
# Seed = derived from script start time, so reruns differ. If you
# want to reproduce a flaky failure, set FUZZ_SEED in the env.

# Pin the auto-fuel loop off for the conservation window. Its Stage-1
# (tickAutoFuel, src/backend/main.mo) BUYS ICP on ICP-ICPUSD with the
# treasury's fee-accrued ICPUSD whenever cycle headroom drops below
# max(2T, burnPerDay) — and a fresh cold-start's seeding burst inflates the
# burnPerDay EMA enough to arm that trigger for the following ~half hour.
# The buy is a legitimate flow, but it lifts the fuzz traders' resting ICP
# asks into treasuryIcpE8s, which the per-token trader sums below exclude —
# and no summation closes the set while the loop is live, because Stage-2
# then BURNS internal ICP outright (backed by the chain spend). Seen once
# mid-suite 2026-08-06 (~05:55): ICP short by exactly one Stage-1 tranche,
# 771,457,372 e8s ≈ the treasury's ~$18.5 accrual at the 2.40±2% band;
# reproduced deterministically by timing a run across the loop's 10-min
# cooldown lapse (deficit == treasuryIcpE8s to the base unit). ICPUSD never
# breaks: the tranche the treasury spends lands on the sellers, both inside
# the quote frame. Restored before finish_test.

#
# For ICPUSD we ALSO fold in the treasury AND the AMM vault balances: the
# symmetric maker/taker fee skims quote-leg ICPUSD out of the trading parties
# and SPLITS it — half to the LP vault (the AMM principal; drain fix 4), half
# to the treasury — on every fill. Including both closes the accounting set so
# the quote total stays conserved exactly. (`setup_mode empty` runs
# resetExchange, which zeroes both, so they start at 0. Base tokens are
# transferred whole and are fee-free, so they need no such terms.)
