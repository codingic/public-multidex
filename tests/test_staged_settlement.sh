# Sealed model — the SETTLEMENT path. Replaces the retired
# test_pending_finalize.sh: there is no PendingMatch window to finalise anymore
# — orders stage sealed and release on the next GEPTOR (or, on a market with no
# AMM pool like this fixture, via the heartbeat's deferred-expiry users-only
# release within a few seconds). What must still hold end-to-end through a live
# user↔user cross:
#   • the cross settles into exactly one real trade,
#   • BOTH sides' reservations return to zero,
#   • balances actually move (seller's base down, buyer's base up),
#   • the symmetric maker/taker quote-leg fee accrues to the TREASURY
#     (this is the live-fill fee guard — the arithmetic is unit-tested in
#     MatchingEngine.test.mo; this proves the deployed wiring skims it).
