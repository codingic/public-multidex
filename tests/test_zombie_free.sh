# Regression: the 0-qty-zombie-order bug (fixed earlier) must stay
# fixed. Specifically: a taker whose entire quantity goes into a
# pending match must NOT leave a 0-qty order in the open-book indexes.
#
# Reproducer:
#   1. Alice places a protected BUY @75000 qty 1.0 (10s window).
#   2. Bob sells 1.0 → taker slice fully goes to pending.
#   3. Before the fix, a zombie ask at 75000 qty=0 would appear in
#      bob's open orders. After the fix, bob has zero open orders.
