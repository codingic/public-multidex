# Regression: AMM inventory-rebalance must actually FIRE when inventory
# drifts off target. This is the regression lock for the bug where
# the dust check `quoteDepthBase * 0.5` always rejected rebalances on
# any pool whose `quoteDepthBase < maxQtyPerTick * 2` — silently
# disabling the entire rebalance defense.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Create an AMM pool (refPrice 75000, 2 BTC + 150k seeded).
#   2. Configure aggressive rebalance: 5% threshold, no cooldown.
#   3. Manipulate the AMM principal's BTC balance to be 50% over
#      target (i.e. 3 BTC against a 2 BTC target).
#   4. Manually trigger rebalance.
#   5. Assert: rebalance ran (lastRebalanceNs > 0), AMM placed a SELL
#      market order (some BTC sold, ICPUSD reserves grew).

# The CORE regression we're locking: rebalance fires when inventory
# is off-target. The previous bug silently disabled it via a dust-
# threshold misconfiguration. So the high-leverage assertion is
# "lastRebalanceNs goes from 0 to non-zero after the trigger."
#
# We DON'T assert exact inventory deltas because the AMM's 2-second
# requote tick interleaves with our test calls and produces protected-
# maker pending matches with 8s windows; the resulting balance flow
# is timing-dependent and not what this test exists to verify. The
# `decideRebalance` math is exercised separately in unit tests.
# Drain-fix regression: the AUTO rebalancer must ship OFF. Inventory recovery
# is passive (one-sided skewed quotes); the taker loop is opt-in for ops only.
