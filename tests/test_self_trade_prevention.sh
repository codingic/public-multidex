# Self-trade prevention, on the BENEFICIAL owner.
#
# A taker must never fill its own resting maker: a self-cross washes volume,
# pollutes candles, and hands the washer free maker/taker volume toward fee
# levels and badges. The engine cancels the resting self-maker and skips it.
#
# The comparison used to be `Principal.equal(taker, maker)` on the RAW
# principals. A margin pool trades under its own derived principal, so a wallet
# crossing its OWN pool looked like two strangers and settled normally — an
# equity-neutral round trip (both sides are you) costing only fees, while
# accruing maker volume at 2x toward the level ladder. The venue already
# resolved pool→owner for rewards; STP now resolves it too, so the two sides
# are compared as the single party that actually benefits.
#
# What this pins:
#   §1 wallet vs its OWN wallet order — prevented (the original behaviour,
#      guarded against regression)
#   §2 wallet vs its OWN MARGIN POOL — prevented (what raw-principal
#      comparison let through)
#   §3 a DIFFERENT user still fills the same order normally — the fix must
#      block self-crossing, not liquidity
#
# Mechanics: a post-only sell at the mark rests as the best ask (the AMM quotes
# a spread around the mark, so its own ask sits above it and its bid below, and
# a post-only order is maker-or-kill so it cannot cross on entry). Anything
# buying at the mark must therefore meet that ask first.
#
# ⚠️ Places real orders on the configured venue; cancels what it places.
