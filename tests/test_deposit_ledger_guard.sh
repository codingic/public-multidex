# Deposit-ledger integrity: the two guards that keep the Bridge's ledger and
# the DEX's high-water from minting money when they disagree.
#
# ── The slice-credit guard (DEX side) ──
# `creditAndRegister(user, token, amount, seq)` credits `seq - prevSeq`, NOT
# `amount`: `seq` is the Bridge's cumulative confirmed high-water, `amount` its
# delta since its own last acked claim, and after a lost #ok reply the Bridge
# re-sends an OVERLAPPING, larger amount. Deriving the slice from our own
# high-water is what stops that double-minting.
#
# That fix has an inverse. If `creditedSeq` ever loses ground while the
# Bridge's `claimed` does not — a reinstall here, a restore from older state, a
# hand-set seq — then `seq - prevSeq` spans the user's whole history and we
# would mint all of it at once. `amount` is the cross-check: the Bridge never
# sends LESS than the slice it owes, so `creditAmt > amount` can only mean the
# two ledgers have diverged. Refuse rather than mint.
#
# ── The in-flight guards (Bridge side) ──
# `claiming` / `admitting` are set before an `await` and cleared in the
# continuation. They are implicitly STABLE (persistent actor), so an upgrade
# landing mid-call used to leave the flag `true` forever and permanently lock
# that (user, asset) out of claiming. `postupgrade` now clears both: no
# continuation survives an upgrade, so a surviving flag can only be a lie.
#
# What this pins:
#   §1 a consistent (amount, seq) pair PASSES the divergence guard
#   §2 the lost-reply shape (amount > slice) passes — that is the normal case
#      the slice fix was built for, and must not be caught by the inverse guard
#   §3 a divergent pair (slice > amount) is REFUSED, with a diagnostic naming
#      both numbers — and nothing is minted
#   §4 replay (seq <= prevSeq) is still a silent no-op, not an error
#   §5 the Bridge still serves after an upgrade, and its stable ledger
#      (`admittedUnits`, `ledgers`) survives while the guards do not
#   §6 THE SLICE ITSELF, at the balance: a credit moves the wallet by
#      `seq - applied`, NOT by `amount` — the arithmetic the CRITICAL
#      double-mint fix turns on, which until now had no balance-level
#      assertion anywhere in the suite
#
# POSTURE DOCTRINE (DEPLOY_MODE in main.mo): #dev runs the SAME user-facing
# code as #play — the verification gate and the deposit cap included — so
# §1-§5 assert identically on both postures: an UNBOUND identity that passes
# the divergence guard is then refused by the verification gate, a distinct
# later error, which is the discriminator §1/§2 use ("did it reach the credit
# path?"). Nothing is ever minted to an unbound principal on ANY posture.
# Every section still uses a FRESH principal so prevSeq is 0 no matter what
# an earlier section did — refused credits never advance creditedSeq today,
# but a reused principal would couple the sections to that implementation
# detail and turn §2's probe into a silent seq<=prevSeq replay if it changed.
#
# Error text proves the guard fired; the balance proves the arithmetic. §6
# binds an identity through the real normalize→hash→bind hook (dev-only) so
# credits LAND and the slice arithmetic is measured at the wallet. On a
# hookless posture (#play install) §6 self-skips with the ⊘ marker — the
# arithmetic stays covered by every #dev run, which is the doctrine.
#
# Never calls resetExchange. Credits land only on throwaway principals that
# are deleted afterwards; no existing account is touched.
