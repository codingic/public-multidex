# Authorization tests — locks in the access-control rules so a future
# refactor of `requireAuth` / `requireController` or per-endpoint owner
# checks can't silently loosen them.
#
# Properties asserted:
#   1. Anonymous principal cannot call requireAuth-gated user endpoints
#      (placeLimitOrder, seedAmmPool, ...).
#   2. cancelMyOrder rejects callers who aren't the order's owner —
#      the "you can only cancel your own order" rule.
#   3. Admin endpoints (resetExchange, setTestBalance, createAmmPool,
#      ...) are controller-gated (Phase-6 hardening): an authenticated
#      NON-controller identity is rejected. We probe this with charlie,
#      never with anonymous — on a local network the anonymous principal
#      IS a controller (and cold_start.sh promotes alice), so an
#      anonymous admin call would SUCCEED locally. On mainnet anonymous
#      is never in the controller list (IC config, not app code).
#   4. debugInspectByUsername is controller-gated even in dev builds
#      (2026-06 pre-mainnet hardening, docs/pre-mainnet-checklist.md).

# only admin endpoints are probed in section (3), because locally
# anonymous IS a controller and would sail through their gate.

# false in every dev/sim deployment). Locks in the 2026-06 pre-mainnet

# built before it, when the endpoint was open to any caller.
