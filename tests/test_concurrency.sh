# Parallel-trader stress test. Asserts that under concurrent order
# placement, the canister's internal accounting stays consistent —
# specifically, total tokens conserved across the sender + receiver of
# every trade.
#
# Why this works on a single-canister IC application: actor messages
# are processed sequentially per canister, but multiple concurrent
# clients can fill the message queue. Bugs that surface only under
# contention (e.g. read-update-write races inside a single async
# function call that awaits) get exposed by parallel injection.
#
# Strategy:
#   1. Snapshot total token supply across N traders + the AMM principal.
#   2. Fire 8 parallel `placeLimitOrder` calls (4 buys, 4 sells) at
#      crossing prices, so trades actually settle.
#   3. After settlement, recompute total token supply.
#   4. Assert: total per-token supply unchanged. Money created or
#      destroyed by a matching-engine bug would fail this immediately.
